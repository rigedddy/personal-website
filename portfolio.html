        Project 1:
        Many students today, as well as people in general, struggle to remain organised and motivated to complete their daily tasks. Even if they may have a to-do list for most of the day, they are unlikely to remember to write it down or even check each item off because there is no incentive for them to do their tasks. If there is a reward for finishing a task, people will be more encouraged to do it, especially if they enjoy computer games but are now attempting to focus on their academics rather than playing games. Users of this task manager will be able to arrange all of their assignments in one location and receive rewards for finishing them. The user can create an avatar for themselves in the role-playing game (RPG) system, and with the points they earn, they can buy items for their character, like accessories, or they might even be able to collect more avatars and even cute animals. <br><br>
This idea was especially picked since, typically, when people manually record activities, they run the risk of losing them. Additionally, a lot of gamers like the concept of how role-playing games operate. Given that players take on the roles of characters in an imaginary world, the game mechanics aren't particularly complex. When applied to the real world, video games allow players to control a fictional character who sets out on a mission in a fictional setting, creating a fun and engaging approach to their daily life.
