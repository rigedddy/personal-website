        Welcome to my little internet corner <3

      <p>
        I am a 17-year-old girl who was born in Brescia, a tiny town in northern Italy; however, <br>I am originally from Bangladesh but now live in London, UK. <br>I attend a sixth form where I study mathematics, computer science, and economics.<br> I enjoy picking up new languages, whether they be spoken languages or programming languages. <br>Along with being a computer nerd, I also enjoy dancing to kpop songs and playing video games. <br>In the future, I want to be to create my own indie game.
